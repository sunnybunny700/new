            <h2>Walnut Wood</h2>
        
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Known for its rich, dark brown color and elegant grain patterns, making it highly sought after for premium furniture and décor.</li>
                    <li>Highly durable and resistant to wear, suitable for long-term use in furniture, flooring, and cabinetry.</li>
                    <li>Easy to carve and shape, allowing for detailed craftsmanship in woodworking projects.</li>
                    <li>Naturally resistant to decay, making it ideal for indoor and moderately protected outdoor use.</li>
                    <li>Finishes beautifully with oil, varnish, or stain, highlighting its natural aesthetic.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <li><strong>Cons</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relatively expensive compared to other hardwoods, which may limit its use for large-scale projects.</li>
                    <li>Can be prone to scratches and dents due to its medium hardness (not as hard as some exotic woods).</li>
                    <li>Requires regular maintenance to preserve its polished look and protect it from UV exposure.</li>
                    <li>Limited natural resistance to prolonged exposure to moisture, making it less ideal for very humid or wet environments without proper treatment.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Local Material Alternatives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cedro:</strong> Similar in workability and durability, with a natural resistance to decay and termites, though lighter in color.</li>
                <li><strong>Majagua:</strong> A dense, durable hardwood often used for tools and construction, known for its resistance to wear but harder to carve.</li>
                <li><strong>Guayacán:</strong> Extremely hard and durable, but significantly heavier and more challenging to work with.</li>
            </ul>
